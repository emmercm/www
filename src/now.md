## 📍 Living in

## 👨🏻‍💼️ Top three professional focuses

1. Exercising strategic thinking muscles, to think beyond daily projects
2. Finding opportunities to have leverage and influence beyond my immediate team
3. Make the most out of my time leading Attentive's technical book club

## 🧘🏻‍♂️ Top three personal focuses

1. Separation between work and personal life, not letting either bleed into the other, especially in a remote role
2. Prioritizing what's most important in life, reducing mental "snacking"
3. Making and keeping meaningful connections

## 👨🏻‍💻 Hacking on

- [`igir`](https://github.com/emmercm/igir), a ROM collection manager, and my first venture into TypeScript and Node.js CLI apps
