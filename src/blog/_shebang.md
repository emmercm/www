No, it's not a [Ricky Martin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricky_Martin) song.

_[Wikpedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)) says the shebang also known as a sharp-exclamation, sha-bang, hashbang, pound-bang, or hash-pling._

Simply put, a shebang tells your operating system where to find a program to interpret your file, and it's used whenever your file is used like an executable. Shebangs look like this:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env sh
```

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
```

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env zsh
```
