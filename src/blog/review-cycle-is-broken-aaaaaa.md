title: your review cycle is broken
draft: true

1 year is too long, even 6 or 3 months is too long

long gaps between reviews increases anxiety around the unknown of what your review contains

if there were specific examples used during the feedback, you may be well past the time that the situation could have been improved

you expect a tight feedback loop on your code, why not your performance?
