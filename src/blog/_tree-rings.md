You can measure the growth of a tree by looking at its rings. Software at your company has rings, too.

I write a lot about [countering](/blog/avoiding-blanket-statements) [negativity](/blog/being-critical-of-past-developers) in software engineering. I believe people have a lot of productive solutions available to them.

I've developed a metaphor recently that has been landing with my colleagues:
  
> Software is like a tree. When you cut it open, you're going to find some growth rings. You'll see when various patterns got popularized across the company, when new libraries were adopted, 
>  
> You and I are both better developers than we were a couple of years ago. We've worked with new people that have brought new ideas, have experience with more design patterns, and have worked with code long enough to understand the pitfalls of past decisions. And everyone else in the company has grown, too, and are likely making decisions that you'd agree with now.

 such as immutable value objects, test doubles for volatile dependencies, package-by-feature organization, and more.
