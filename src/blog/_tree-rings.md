You can measure the growth of a tree by looking at its rings. Software at your company has rings, too.

I write a lot about countering negativity in software engineering.

When a colleague expresses frustration with the state of some code (especially if inherited from another team), I've developed an optimistic way of looking at things:  
  
> Software is like a tree. When you cut it open, you're going to find some growth rings. You'll see when various patterns got popularized across the company such as immutable value objects, test doubles for volatile dependencies, package-by-feature organization, and more.  
>  
> You and I are both better developers than we were a couple of years ago. We've worked with new people that have brought new ideas, have experience with more design patterns, and have worked with code long enough to understand the pitfalls of past decisions. And everyone else in the company has grown, too, and are likely making decisions that you'd agree with now.
