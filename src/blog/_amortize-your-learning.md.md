The time required to learn something new can be large, but you can make that cost worth it by teaching it to others.

I would even go so far as to say that it's your _responsibility_ to make it easier for the next person to learn the same topic.

_Credit to [Tanya Reilly](https://noidea.dog/) and her book [The Staff Engineer's Path](https://noidea.dog/staff) for the idea for this article. Tanya describes amortizing the cost of creating a curriculum by teaching it multiple times (p. 268), but I think the same applies to documentation, just on a smaller scale._

Here's a situation: your team uses some piece of technology, and let's say it's older or more difficult to find reliable documentation on. You spend multiple days investigating a workaround to an issue or a setting you know you want to change, but can't find anything relevant on the internet. You decide to check out the code yourself, and end up further down the rabbit hole. You eventually find the functionality that you're looking for, and you're able to achieve the desired outcome.

Here's an even more frustrating situation: you've been tasked with modifying an older system that has very little tribal knowledge left at your company. You find some documentation and it looks promising, until you realize it's years out of date. You once again end up doing code archaeology to find what you need. You find it, spend a nightmarish amount of time testing it, and eventually make your change successfully.

What's missing from these two scenarios? _Making the life of the next person better_. You spent significant time gaining a lot of valuable context to accomplish your task - you should share that context!

## Audience one: yourself

Taking either of the above situations, let's say that you made your change and were able to move on with your life. You get to work on other projects, and life is good. But then business needs change, and you have to revisit your old friend, the poorly-documented system.

_But it's been so long that you lost all of your hard-earned context._

Don't you wish that past you had left bread crumbs for future you? Your archaeology will likely take less time your second time, but it will still be costly. Spending even ten minutes to have written some documentation could have saved you days of frustration. Be selfish, leave future you some bread crumbs today!

Here are some example how-to topics:

- How-to run your service or its tests locally - it might not be straight-forward
- How-to remotely SSH into your service - your team instructions might differ from others

## Audience two: your organization

## Audience three: the public
