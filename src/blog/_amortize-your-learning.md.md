The time required to learn something new can be large, but you can make that cost worth it by teaching it to others.

I would even go so far as to say that it's your _responsibility_ to make it easier for the next person to learn the same topic.

_Credit to [Tanya Reilly](https://noidea.dog/) and her book [The Staff Engineer's Path](https://noidea.dog/staff) for the idea for this article. Tanya describes amortizing the cost of creating a curriculum by teaching it multiple times (p. 268), but I think the same applies to documentation, just on a smaller scale._

Here's a situation: your team uses some piece of technology, and let's say it's older or more difficult to find reliable documentation on. You spend multiple days investigating a workaround to an issue or a setting you know you want to change, but can't find anything relevant on the internet. You decide to check out the code yourself, and end up further down the rabbit hole. You eventually find the functionality that you're looking for, and you're able to achieve the desired outcome.
