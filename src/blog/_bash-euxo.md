title: Safer Bash Scripts Through Shell Options
tags:
- shell

---

Unlike typical programming languages, Bash doesn't terminate when it encounters an exception.

Here's an example dangerous scenario:

```bash
for dir in 
```

1. At the top of every bash file
2. As the Docker shell
3. In GitHub Actions steps?
4. In subshells within functions?

	```bash
	func() {
		(
			set -euo pipefail
		)
	}
	```
