draft: true

- Slack warnings are noise that are easy to ignore
- Pages give you metrics you can actually track against
- Opinion on pages don't necessarily have to be incidents
	- Though incidents can help give you the air cover and support you need
- Also make sure you're monitoring symptoms, not causes
