A number of months ago I found myself teaching the same concept over and over to others at work -- deployments. Not what to deploy, that's usually pretty obvious. Not when to deploy, I'm a big believer of deploying early and often. And not even how to deploy, that's usually covered by repository READMEs or handled by CI/CD. But everything else involved that isn't obvious.

And this makes a lot of sense, I've never seen a computer science or bootcamp curriculum that covers this topic. It's the kind of thing you tend to learn from those around you at your first job. Do you know how to check the code is working? Do you know what could go wrong? Do you know how to fix things if they go wrong? Mindfulness plays a larger role than developers might think.

So I did my civic duty and wrote a Confluence article on the subject that I'm now rewriting here.

## When should you deploy?

A lot of this is up to your organization. Some release many times a day, once a day, once a week, once a sprint, or even once a quarter. It really depends on your type of software, the clients' needs, and your business model.

But I'm a big fan of deploy early, deploy often. The [GitHub Flow](http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html) was designed around making deployments easy and reliable enough that any developer could deploy with confidence. It defines "when" as immediately after merging code into a deployable branch (`master`, `staging`, etc.).

This does three things:

- It lets you catch smaller bugs earlier rather than larger bugs later. If you keep the amount of code you're merging smaller you reduce your risks.
- It enforces individual responsibility. If the merged code isn't deployed immediately it is left as a possible time bomb for the next person. There may be known risks with the code that only the authors know about and can monitor for.
- It keeps `master` clean. Only production-ready code is merged to `master`, and if the code isn't deployed in a short amount of time after merge it should be reverted out.

## Are you triple sure you're ready to deploy?

It might seem obvious, but you probably want a second and third pair of eyes on the code you're about to deploy. In the [GitHub Flow](http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html) this is done through pull requests.

Depending on your development environments it's a good idea to test your code in a prod-like staging environment. This will help highlight any errors in the code or deployment itself. This also allows stakeholders to test the acceptance criteria.

Depending on your organization's structure you may want a QA engineer to test your changes as well. They have the skills and training to look for issues such as validation errors and edge cases.

It's also a good idea to give your code diff one more review before merging, there may have been a gap of time between writing the code and merging it and reviewing it again with a fresh pair of eyes can be helpful.

## Is there an "image" that needs to be built?

It's popular for web services to be built into a Docker image that packages all code and code dependencies together. One of the main goals of containers is to provide consistency between environments.

The code you want to deploy may require a Docker image to be built, and those build instructions are going to vary slightly between codebases. If it does require a Docker image to be built it probably also requires pushing that image to a container registry such as Docker Hub or Quay.io. Consult your organization's instructions for containers.

## Do you know what needs to happen before deploying?

The code being deployed may depend on some new infrastructure or external services, it would be a good idea to make sure those are still working.

There may also be some additional steps that need to be taken such as manual database migrations without a tool.

## Do you know how to deploy this codebase?

I personally believe the deployment instructions for a codebase should live in its README. Your code may require updating a Kubernetes deployment or uploading files to an SFTP server, it really depends on your organization and its needs.

## Have you deployed this codebase before?

If you haven't, it's a good idea to sit with an existing code owner and have them walk you through the process. There could be some tribal knowledge of landmines you should be aware of.

Again, I personally believe the deployment instructions for a codebase should live in its README, but documentation is a continuous process that will never be perfect so there may be missing or inaccurate steps.

## Do you know what needs to happen after the deploy?

Sometimes there's steps to take after a deploy such as running a database migration tool manually. Instructions should be in the codebase's README.

## Do you know how to verify the deployed code is working?

An often forgotten step of deployment is ensuring the code deployed is working as expected and meets acceptance criteria in production.

> It work on both my machine and in staging, shouldn't it work in production? Why do I need to check?

There's always differences in environments, and things like different load at scale can make the code behave differently.

You should also check the code is working before communicating it's live to others, it's pretty embarrassing when someone else catches your mistakes. 

## Who should you notify after a successful deployment?

Are there any Scrum Masters or project managers you need to notify the change is live? Do you need to notify the stakeholders directly? Someone probably wants to know about the changes!

## Do you know how to determine if the deployed code is producing new errors?

Like I mentioned above, it's pretty embarrassing when someone else catches your mistakes. As the deployer of the code it's your responsibility to ensure you didn't introduce any new errors.

You're going to want to keep an eye on monitoring tools you use in your organization such as: log aggregators for new errors, performance monitors for any significant changes in requests per minute or response time, and hardware monitors to watch CPU and memory.

## Do you know how to determine if the deployed code caused any of its dependents to produce new errors?

In an ever-interconnected world it's likely there is other code that is dependent on the code you just deployed, and it's important that you maintain your stability and contracts for it. You may need to communicate changes to developers elsewhere in your organization so they can watch their codebases for errors.

The above section about monitoring for new errors can be applied to these dependents.

## Do you know how to recover from a bad deploy?

I can't stress how import this is. Bad deploys and production errors happen to the best developers regardless of skill level or attention to detail. There's no faster way to find edge cases and performance problems than releasing new code into production.

### Immediately deploy the last known "good" version

Without hesitation, at the first sign of errors you can positively attribute to the new deployment you need to deploy the last known "good" version. Fixing errors in production is not acceptable to most businesses.

Many times the instructions for this are the same as a normal deployment but with an old version number, but the codebase's README should have instructions or should link to documentation that has the instructions.

Be mindful of any extra steps such as reversing database migrations if required.

### Then reverting out the "bad" code

Immediately after the deploy you need to revert the "bad" code out of the branch you just deployed. I consider this non-optional. This is to protect the next person who deploys the same code from including these errors again in their deploy, and this can be especially dangerous with the `master` or default branch.

In GitHub, at the bottom of pull request pages there exists a "revert" button on the same line as the merge status - this will create a new revert pull request for you. You need to immediately communicate with the codebase's code owners to get it approved and merged before anyone has a change to deploy that branch again.

After the "bad" code has been reverted out of the branch only then is it safe to start development to fix any errors seen during or after deployment.

## Conclusion
