title: Be a Engineer Who Invites Collaboration
draft: true

---

maybe also an engineer who invites feedback? maybe this should be generalized as be an engineer who expresses vulnerability?

Ways to do it:

- Invite for early review of RFCs
- Invite for pairing sessions (of topics you know especially well)

Ways it helps:

- Onboards
- Shares opportunities with juniors
