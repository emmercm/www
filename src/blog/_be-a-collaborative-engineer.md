title: Be an Engineer Who Invites Collaboration
draft: true

---

I don't care if you're a 10x engineer, I care if we can build great things _together_.

Reflecting on times where I had high friction with a colleague, either on a single project or over a longer term, I had a thought: _I work best with, and am motivated most by, people who want to work with others_.

Sure, I want to work with smart engineers, there's a lot to be learned from being around engineers with experience that's different from or deeper than mine. But I don't need to work with so-called 10x engineers; I want to work with capable engineers with a strong sense of ownership, a learner mindset, and an eagerness to _invite collaboration_.

I do not think it is enough to be _able_ to collaborate. Instead, I think the bar should be raised to: actively identifying situations where collaboration _is possible_, and actively _inviting_ peers to collaborate with you.

## In practice

To clarify my point, here are some scenarios where an engineer can invite collaboration:

- **Architectural design / contract definition / RFC writing.** Many engineers wait until an RFC is fully written before sharing it with their peers. Instead, try bringing others into your thought process early to create learning opportunities (for both you and them!) and gain an early advocate for your design. Further, seeking input from someone with a different set of experiences is likely to create a stronger design.
- **Experimentation / proof-of-concepts / performance tuning.** If a project's goal is to learn through iteration, such that some decision can be made in the end, try bringing others along. A lot of learning happens through trial and error, and these learnings don't always make it into a results readout. The effective methodologies used during the experiment can likely be used again!
- **Process definition.** Processes typically affect many people, so if you're defining or proposing one that will affect your peers, try inviting one or two along early in your thought process. Process could include: code linter norms, testing norms, document norms, or meeting norms.

Collaboration doesn't just mean inviting a second opinion, there are other scenarios where you can scale others:

- **Using subject matter expertise.** Are you uniquely more experienced in an area than your peers because of past experience or a hobby? Invite them to walk through the task with you! This requires active thought on your part to identify these situations, but your peer will surely remember the kind deed.
- **Documenting knowledge.** Whether it's documenting existing architecture or writing a process [how-to guide](/blog/amortize-your-learning-by-writing-how-to-guides), walking someone else through the process will not only give them a private lesson, it will make you think deeper and force you to express more clearly.

## Why it matters to others

- Onboards
- Shares opportunities with juniors

## Why it can matter to you

- Builds leadership skill, especially in the ability to grow others
- Builds communication skills
- Grows your network
- Builds staff+ skills of scaling others

maybe also an engineer who invites feedback? maybe this should be generalized as be an engineer who expresses vulnerability?
