title: Be an Engineer Who Invites Collaboration
draft: true

---

I don't care if you're a 10x engineer, I care if we can build great things together.

Reflecting on times where I had high friction with a colleague, either on a single project or over a longer term, I've landed on the thought: _I work best with, and am motivated most by, people who want to work with others_.

Sure, I want to work with smart engineers, there's a lot to be learned by being around engineers with experience that's different from or deeper than mine. But I don't need to work with so-called 10x engineers; I want to work with capable engineers with strong ownership, ...


maybe also an engineer who invites feedback? maybe this should be generalized as be an engineer who expresses vulnerability?

Ways to do it:

- Invite for early review of RFCs
- Invite for pairing sessions (of topics you know especially well)

Ways it helps:

- Onboards
- Shares opportunities with juniors
