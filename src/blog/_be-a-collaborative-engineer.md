title: Be an Engineer Who Invites Collaboration
draft: true

---

I don't care if you're a 10x engineer, I care if we can build great things _together_.

Reflecting on times where I had high friction with a colleague, either on a single project or over a longer term, I've landed on the thought: _I work best with, and am motivated most by, people who want to work with others_.

Sure, I want to work with smart engineers, there's a lot to be learned by being around engineers with experience that's different from or deeper than mine. But I don't need to work with so-called 10x engineers; I want to work with capable engineers with strong ownership, a learner mindset, and an eagerness to _invite collaboration_.

I do not think it is enough to be _able_ to collaborate. Instead, I think the bar should be raised to: actively identifying situations where collaboration _is possible_, and actively inviting peers to collaborate with you.

## In practice

To clarify my point, here are some scenarios where a person can invite collaboration:

**Architectural design / contract definition / RFC writing.** Many engineers wait until an RFC is fully written before sharing it with their peers. Instead, try bringing others into your thought process early, to create learning opportunities and gain an advocate. There is nothing worse than putting an RFC up for review and have it receive a dozen comments questioning it

**Experimentation / proof-of-concepts / performance tuning.** If the point of a project is to learn through iteration, such that some decision can be made in the end, try bringing others along. A lot of learning happens through trial and error, and these learnings don't always make it into a results readout. The effective methodologies used during the experiment can likely be used again!

**Process definition.** Processes typically affect many people, so if you're defining or proposing one that will affect your peers, try inviting one or two along early in your thought process.


maybe also an engineer who invites feedback? maybe this should be generalized as be an engineer who expresses vulnerability?

Ways to do it:

- Invite for early review of RFCs
- Invite for pairing sessions (of topics you know especially well)

Ways it helps:

- Onboards
- Shares opportunities with juniors
