title: Be an Engineer Who Invites Collaboration
draft: true

---

I don't care if you're a 10x engineer, I care if we can build great things together.

Reflecting on times where I had high friction with a colleague, either on a single project or over a longer term, I've landed on the thought: _I work best with people who want to work with others_.


maybe also an engineer who invites feedback? maybe this should be generalized as be an engineer who expresses vulnerability?

Ways to do it:

- Invite for early review of RFCs
- Invite for pairing sessions (of topics you know especially well)

Ways it helps:

- Onboards
- Shares opportunities with juniors
