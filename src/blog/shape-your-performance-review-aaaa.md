title: Help Focus Peer Reviews of You
draft: true

foo

- i can't remember what i worked on in the last 6-12 months, there's no way someone else will
- when requesting constructive feedback in an area it reduces peer discomfort providing it
- sharing your past and future focus areas helps peers give feedback on where you succeeded and where you can continue to focus
- reason against: might anchor people, they might not discuss areas outside your focus areas
