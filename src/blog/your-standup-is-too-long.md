The Agile Alliance recommends 15 minutes daily, I would recommend even shorter and less often.

## What is a standup?

From the Agile Alliance's [glossary](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/daily-meeting/):

> Each day at the same time, the team meets so as to bring everyone up to date on the information that is vital for coordination: each team members briefly describes any "completed" contributions and any obstacles that stand in their way.

The goal is to have a set time on some cadence to share information and build cohesion among team members. Though I disagree with the rigid format that every team member must speak on every prompt every standup.

> This meeting is normally timeboxed to a maximum duration of 15 minutes, though this may need adjusting for larger teams. To keep the meeting short, any topic that starts a discussion is cut short, added to a “parking lot” list, and discussed in greater depth after the meeting, between the people affected by the issue.

The discussion topics during a standup need to be relevant to the gross majority of the team, or they're saved until the end when smaller groups can break off and discuss. This ensures that it's a good use of everyone's time.

## The problems

We're going to assume a few points about the average team:

- The team is long-lived with people allocation relatively stable
- The team is working on multiple projects at the same time, with at least some team members on disparate projects

Given that, the Agile Alliance [page](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/daily-meeting/) calls out four common problems, along with my commentary:

- **The meeting devolves into status-giving/gathering meeting.**

  This culture usually comes from the scrum leader. Most of the time this information can be learned from a ticket-tracking system, so asking contributors to do it is duplicative. Gathering status every day also leads us to the next point, standups that last too long.

  Requiring every team member to provide a status update every day, or even every other day, conveys a sense of micromanagement. Team members must provide meaningful updates every day, otherwise they risk being seen as unproductive. Even if the status update is in reality the same (e.g. "still working on task X"), team members may feel the need to go into deeper details to look productive.

- **The meeting lasts too long.**

  This can happen when people share updates that are not important to the rest of the team. Assuming we've eliminated status-giving that is likely not relevant to the entire team, the information left to convey is learnings, opportunities, and impediments. (TODO: expand)

  Teams that have many projects with as few as 1 person on each can run into this problem.

- **People are lukewarm about the meeting and "forget" to have it.**

- **Depending on your company's culture, it can be difficult to share impediments.**

  This tells me team members already lack psychological safety in their job, so requiring team members to speak on their work every day in a group setting is likely eroding it further.

Some other reasons could be:

- **The team is too large or working on too many disparate projects.**

  I believe strongly that people produce their best work when they're collaborating with others, so this is an organizational problem smell to me.

## The monetary cost

[U.S. News](https://money.usnews.com/careers/best-jobs/software-developer/salary) says the median developer salary in 2020 was $110,140. If we say a salaried person gets paid 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, that works out to a wage of $52.95/hour.

If we say a team has 8 people, the cost of everyone on the team attending a meeting is $423.60/hour.

If we say a team holds standup for 30 minutes every day, 5 days a week, the total cost of standup is $1,059/week.

The question I want you to think on is: _are you getting more than $1,000 worth of value out of your standups every week?_

_Realistically the cost will be higher because every meeting is a distraction from deep work that requires expensive context switching._

## Alternatives

I would suggest trying a few different strategies to see what works for the team:

- Asynchronous standup over instant messenger.
- Not talking about daily tasks or accomplishments at all
- Fewer synchronous standups (every other day)

do you trust people to bring up blockers in real-time, or will they wait until standup to bring it up?
