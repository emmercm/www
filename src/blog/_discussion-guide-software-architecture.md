A guide with discussion prompts for Neal Ford, Mark Richards, Pramod Sadalage, and Zhamak Dehghani's [Software Architecture: The Hard Parts: Modern Trade-Off Analyses for Distributed Architectures](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/software-architecture-the/9781492086888/).

I run the engineering book club at my current company, [Attentive](https://www.attentive.com/). For the pace of our book club, we committed to reading X chapters every 2 weeks. I personally appreciate having multiple discussions over time, I find I better retain content that way. These are the exact discussion prompts I used over the few months of reading the book, so they're colored by my personal experience and the current culture at Attentive. All prompts are wholly my own and are free to use by all.
