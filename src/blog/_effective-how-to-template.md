Having a template when writing technical how-to guides can increase clarity and therefore usability.

## A cloneable how-to guide template

Everything below this division can be made into a standalone page in your organization's documentation tool of choice. The goal is to help engineers take the guesswork out of what a how-to guide should contain to be effective.

When this tool is verbally presented to engineers, it is important to index on this phrase: **you get better at what you practice**. Engineers may feel that they aren't good at creating documentation like this (and that might be true), but they can't get good without practice. Having a template to follow like this reduces the barrier to entry.

> ℹ️ This page has been written so that it can be easily copied/pasted to serve as a starting point for an incident runbook. All sections marked as a “note,” including this introduction, are done to be easily deletable.
>
> ⚠️ This how-to guide expresses the author’s opinions, as every how-to guide does. There is not a single correct way to write a how-to guide, and not all sections apply to every how-to guide.
>
> ✅ This guide is based on the following tenets. A how-to guide _should_ be:
>
> -   An ordered list of actions to complete a specific, repeatable task
> -   Specific - the guide should cover as small of an action as is still useful, and then related how-to guides should be cross-linked together
> -   A single, authoritative guide – there should be no documents that could conflict 
>
> ❌ An how-to guide should _not_ be:
>
> -   Written once and never reviewed for accuracy again
> -   An incident runbook on how to resolve a severe issue (see "[An Effective Incident Runbook Template](/blog/an-effective-incident-runbook-template)"). But how-to guides may be linked to from incident runbooks.
